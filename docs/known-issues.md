# Known Issues

Status tracker for accessibility-mod work, in five buckets:

- **Bugs** — regressions or broken behaviour to fix.
- **Unreproduced** — reported issues we can't reliably reproduce yet; need a repro before fixing.
- **Planned** — future feature work that's not currently in flight.
- **Monitor** — shipped features whose behaviour we're still watching in live play.
- **Polish** — quality-of-life refinements; the feature works but has rough edges.

When an entry is closed, move it out of this file (the corresponding fix or commit message is the durable record).

### Beacon-active navigation announcements (remaining-route reading)

While a beacon (or autowalk) is active, the route announcements should describe the *remaining* way to the active waypoint — leading with the range and direction of the current target — rather than the full original route. The hard part is disambiguating intents: if the player selects another object just to hear where it is, the announcement must not balloon into the long, confusing full-route description for the beacon target. Design questions to resolve: how to keep "where is this thing I just selected" reads short while a beacon is running, and whether the separate Shift+Enter autowalk / Shift+`-` gestures are still needed at all, or whether they can be folded into / replaced by the plain selection + beacon flow. See `project_narrated_target_unified.md` and `project_map_cycle_architecture.md`.

### Nameable personal map pins

Let players give their own map pins a name when they drop one, and read that name back when cycling to the pin. Personal pins currently announce only a generic label plus position, so a player who marks several spots can't tell them apart. Needs a text-entry path that works from the keyboard with a screen reader (the editbox handling shipped for chargen + save naming — `menus_editbox.cpp` — is the closest existing mechanism, though map pins aren't an engine editbox so the entry surface differs), storage of the label alongside the pin in the save, and the cycle/focus announcements updated to speak it. See `project_narrated_target_unified.md` / `map_user_markers.cpp`.

### Bundle the resolution / widescreen patch — once we are out of beta

Offer the community resolution / widescreen + HR-menus patches as an installer option, and make our own code robust to the layout changes they introduce. Deliberately deferred until the mod leaves beta: it widens the support surface (several of our paths still assume a particular screen geometry — screen-pixel coordinates, the OS cursor, hardcoded hit-test offset compensations), and a beta is the wrong time to add a second variable to every bug report. Prerequisite when we do take it on: audit every place we depend on screen geometry and read it live from the engine instead of assuming. See `docs/installer.md` (Widescreen / HR-menus bundling) and the `project_radial_cursor_coupling` memory.

### KOTOR 2 does not refuse impossible actions — we announce their absence instead

A medkit used on a full-health character behaves differently in the two engines, and only one of them tells the player anything.

KOTOR 1 refuses it at the GUI layer: `DoPersonalAction` finds the entry's usable bit clear, plays its error sound, and never dispatches. The entry's flag word carries a reason code, so we speak the engine's own sentence — logged as `ActionBar: variant flags ... usable=0 reason=5` followed by `refused — speaking engine reason strref=0xa602 [Volle Gesundheit]`.

KOTOR 2 mostly cannot: the answer to this entry's original open question (decompiled 2026-08-12, the dead-Medicine-row investigation) is that K2's item appender **never initialises the flag word for inventory items** — only the three equipped-slot entries get one. What we read there is heap garbage (ASCII string fragments in the logs), the engine gates on the same garbage, and `VariantRefusal` therefore skips the refusal verdict for K2 item entries entirely (a garbage bit would fake a refusal with a random reason). Force/feat entries DO compute real flags on K2 — "Macht erschöpft" (`usable=0 reason=1`) was observed live — so the mechanism exists, it is just never fed for items. The no-op watch stays as the honest answer for silent item refusals.

**The K2 Medicine row needed a deeper fix (2026-08-12).** K2 gives every medical-category item a TWO-STEP use flow: the press arms a target-pick (MainInterface `+0x15230` armed / `+0x15234` party slot) that only a mouse click on a party portrait completes — and `DoPersonalAction`'s preamble wipes the state before the medical handler reads it, so from the keyboard the row can never fire at all (one press wedges it armed-with-no-slot; the 2026-08-11 21:58 "flip" in this playthrough was simply the first medical press whose base-item row byte routes into the two-step flow). The shipped answer bypasses that machinery: `SendUseItemRequestK2` emits the same client→server use-item message the portrait click's consume path emits, and the unified menu adds a party-member picker (narrated member preselected, Shift+Enter = instant self, bare 5 = instant self). The `Diag.UseItemReq` hook on the message writer doubles as the no-op watch's cancel signal: a sent request proves the press acted, which also fixed mines announcing "Nicht möglich" while visibly planting (they act without a combat-round add).

**One false-positive class found and fixed (2026-08-08).** The watch was armed for every menu fire, and target-row actions tripped it three for three on a footlocker: Sicherheit, Sicherheits-Überbrücker, and a Schallmine that visibly blew the lock open all announced "Nicht möglich" while working perfectly (`patch-20260808-103232.log`). Target rows act without a combat-round add as a matter of course, so the watch is now armed only for the personal block — `ArmNoOpWatch`, called from the menu's personal path and from bare 4..7, never from `ArmUserQueueAdd` itself.

**Still watching:** KOTOR 2's Combat Behaviour column (key 8) may legitimately queue nothing — if it does it will wrongly announce "Nicht möglich" and needs the same send-witness treatment. And a server-side drop of a direct-sent medical item (e.g. full health) is silent-then-generic rather than reasoned — the engine's client-side CanUseItem gate (`0x005D2F80`) is skipped by the direct send and could later supply real reasons.

Code: `engine_actionbar.cpp` (`VariantRefusal`, `SendUseItemRequestK2`, the always-on flags log), `combat_queue.cpp` (`ArmUserQueueAdd` / `TickNoOpWatch`), `combat_diag.cpp` (`OnUseItemRequestK2`), `unified_action_menu.cpp` (`SpeakRefusal`, the medical party picker).

### Starting an autowalk/beacon while one is active should switch, not cancel

If an autowalk or beacon is already running and the player triggers a new autowalk or beacon on a different target, the current behaviour just cancels the existing one. Instead it should immediately start the new action on the new target — switching the route in one gesture rather than requiring cancel-then-start.

### Mod-settings sliders only save after pressing Enter

The sliders under Mod-Einstellungen (e.g. hint-sound volume) only persist their new value to `acc_settings.ini` once the user presses Enter on the row. Adjusting a slider with Left / Right changes it for the session and previews the new level, but the change isn't written until an explicit Enter — so a player who tweaks a slider and leaves the menu without pressing Enter loses the change on next launch. Slider adjustments should persist on each Left / Right step (the same way the value already updates live), without needing a confirming keypress.

### Fold in human translation contributions as they arrive

Most of the mod's non-German, non-English text is machine-drafted — the in-game strings for French, Italian, Spanish, Russian and Polish, and the installer's `Locales/{fr,it,es}.json`. They are correct in structure (key parity verified) but the phrasing, formal-vs-informal address, and modding terminology may read awkwardly to a native ear. German is human-authored by the maintainer and is the quality bar. As native speakers contribute corrections, merge them; PRs against the individual string files are a well-scoped contribution to point people at.
